# Cinnamon and Nemo integration

The installer adds a separate AutoUpscale launcher and Nemo file action. The
launcher uses VLC's low-overhead direct filter path. The Nemo action uses a
transcode display path so stock VLC 3 preserves the enlarged frame dimensions.
Neither modifies VLC's standard desktop entry.

## Install

Build and install the VLC plugin first, then run:

```sh
scripts/install-vlc-autoupscale-action.sh
```

The script locates VLC with `whereis`, validates the AutoUpscale, x264, and
FFmpeg encoder modules when possible, and installs:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/bin/vlc-autoupscale` | Wrapper with AutoUpscale defaults |
| `~/.local/share/applications/vlc-autoupscale.desktop` | Launcher and Open With entry |
| `~/.local/share/nemo/actions/vlc-autoupscale.nemo_action` | Forced-1080p Nemo action using the compatible transcode display path |

Remove all three files with:

```sh
scripts/install-vlc-autoupscale-action.sh --uninstall
```

## Launcher and Open With profile

The wrapper defaults to explicit 1080p, Spline36, and 20% USM, in a separate
VLC instance so an already-running player cannot absorb the filter options.
Replace its entire option set with `VLC_AUTOUPSCALE_ARGS`:

```sh
VLC_AUTOUPSCALE_ARGS='--video-filter=autoupscale --autoupscale-target=1 --autoupscale-algo=1 --autoupscale-usm=0' vlc-autoupscale clip.mkv
```

The replacement must include `--video-filter=autoupscale`. An empty value
launches plain VLC. The value is a whitespace-separated option list; the
wrapper deliberately does not evaluate shell quoting or wildcard expansion.
Pass media filenames as normal wrapper arguments, not through this variable.
This environment override applies only to direct mode.

## Nemo profile

The **Play with VLC (AutoUpscale 1080p)** action has a fixed profile:

- 1080p target, Spline36, and 20% USM;
- software decoding to avoid VLC 3 hardware-converter chain failures;
- a separate VLC instance so another player cannot absorb the action options;
- real-time x264 video transcoding to preserve the enlarged dimensions at
  the display; audio passes through without requested re-encoding.

The installed wrapper owns this profile. Run it independently with:

```sh
vlc-autoupscale --transcode-display clip.mkv
```

`--transcode-display` ignores `VLC_AUTOUPSCALE_ARGS` so desktop environment
settings cannot weaken the action's fixed profile. Check its VLC module
requirements without starting playback:

```sh
vlc-autoupscale --check-transcode-display
```

The transcode path costs more CPU than direct playback. The target also keeps
the plugin's 4x linear scaling cap: a 640x360 source reaches 1920x1080, while a
320x240 source reaches 1280x960. Re-running the installer restores this fixed
profile and overwrites local edits to the installed wrapper, desktop entry, and
action file.

On VLC 3.0, the GUI and VLC hotkeys do not control the private audio output
created by this profile. Use the system mixer for live volume changes. For a
fixed startup gain with a direct VLC command, see
[Transcode display volume on VLC 3.0](USAGE.md#transcode-display-volume-on-vlc-30).

## Troubleshoot

If the action does not appear, restart Nemo:

```sh
nemo --quit
```

Inspect action parsing from a terminal:

```sh
nemo --quit
NEMO_DEBUG=Actions nemo --debug
```

Confirm the direct wrapper and plugin independently:

```sh
~/.local/bin/vlc-autoupscale path/to/video.mp4
vlc --list | grep autoupscale
```

To verify the Nemo profile, run `vlc-autoupscale --check-transcode-display`,
then launch a video through the action and inspect VLC's messages for
`AutoUpscale engaged` and `destination (after video filters)`.

Only install or edit action files you trust. Selected filenames are untrusted
input; pass them as quoted arguments rather than constructing shell commands.

For playback settings, see [Usage](USAGE.md).

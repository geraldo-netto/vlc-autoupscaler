 * usm_pool.h - threaded USM (unsharp mask) post-pass
 *****************************************************************************
 * Wraps a persistent pool of worker threads that apply USM to a luma
 * plane in horizontal stripes. Bit-identical output to up_usm_apply_plane
 * for any combination of (width, height, amount_q8, src) inputs.
 *
 * Algorithm: fused single-pass sweep — one dispatch per frame; each
 * worker hblurs into three private rolling row buffers and combines on
 * the fly, re-hblurring stripe-boundary rows locally so no worker reads
 * another's memory (full rationale in usm_pool.c's header note).
 *
 * The pool follows the same lifecycle as the zimg backend: cheap
 * create() allocates only the small priv struct; private scratch is allocated
 * and worker threads are spawned lazily on the first apply() call.
 *
 * At the public API level, amount_q8 == 0 takes a fast identity path with no
 * thread or scratch setup. The plugin omits the pool entirely when USM is off.
 *****************************************************************************/

/*
 * !!! IF YOU ADD OR REMOVE A PUBLIC FUNCTION HERE !!!
 *
 * src/usm_pool_dispatch.c hand-forwards every public symbol to one of
 * three SIMD-baseline-compiled variants (sse2/avx2/avx512). It does NOT
 * use IFUNC/target_clones, so adding a new public function here without
 * also adding a forwarding shim in usm_pool_dispatch.c and an entry in
 * usm_pool_variants.h's declaration macro will produce an unresolved
 * symbol at .so load.
 *
 * Conversely, deleting a function here without deleting it from the
 * dispatcher will produce three orphaned symbols and a linker error.
 *
 * Prototype changes are covered: all variant-suffix declarations live
 * only in usm_pool_variants.h, and usm_pool.c includes it under
 * -DUSM_VARIANT, so declaration/definition drift is a compile error.

 * neighbouring workers never read a row another worker is writing
 * (SYS-4). Same-base/different-stride calls are rejected; other partial
 * overlap (different base pointers whose ranges overlap) is unsupported.
 * Returns UP_USM_APPLY_OK on success,
 * UP_USM_APPLY_FAILED_UNCHANGED when validation or lazy initialization fails
 * before dst is touched, and UP_USM_APPLY_OUTPUT_UNCERTAIN when dispatch fails
 * after workers may have written dst. The latter drains the workers and attempts
 * to join them (failed joins retain pool state until a successful retry),
 * leaves the pool in a sticky failed state, and requires the caller to discard
 * the destination frame. The completion wait is timed, but safe retirement is
 * synchronous and may wait for an already-running worker callback; this API
 * does not promise a hard end-to-end execution deadline.

 * The API defensively clamps values outside [0, UP_USM_AMOUNT_Q8_MAX]
 * (matching the single-threaded behavior). amount_q8 == 0 is a fast
 * identity copy with no thread or workspace activity.

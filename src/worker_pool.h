 * worker_pool.h — shared persistent worker-pool lifecycle for AutoUpscale
 *****************************************************************************
 * ARCH-2. The USM pool (usm_pool.c) and the zimg worker grid (scaler_zimg.c)
 * ran two parallel state machines with identical semantics: sticky lazy init,
 * poison-on-barrier-failure, cache-line-aligned worker array, partial-spawn
 * teardown, one-broadcast dispatch and wait. Only the gate (pool_gate.h) had
 * been factored out, so every reliability fix had to land twice — and several
 * had landed in one pool only.
 *
 * This header owns everything above the gate:
 *
 *   - the worker payload array (one 64-byte-aligned slot per worker; the
 *     payload TYPE stays private to each pool, the pool only knows its size),
 *   - the thread records (pthread_t + per-worker seen_gen),
 *   - lazy start with sticky failure, partial-spawn policy, teardown,
 *   - dispatch-and-wait, and poison (broken pools stop their threads).
 *
 * Pools plug in through up_worker_pool_ops_t. Only `construct` and `run` are
 * required; the rest are optional hooks.
 *
 * PERF-1 (inline_run): a one-worker pool has no parallelism to buy, so no gate
 * is initialized and no thread is spawned — up_worker_pool_dispatch runs the
 * single slot on the calling thread. Zimg AUTO uses this path with <= 7
 * allowed CPUs; USM AUTO separately considers output area and allowed CPUs.
 *
 * Threading contract (inherited from the gate, see pool_gate.h): the owner
 * writes per-dispatch worker state before up_worker_pool_dispatch; workers
 * publish their results through the done barrier. No worker touches another
 * worker's slot.
